Yay, this so awesome :rocket:

## To Do:

- Add floats to sdfloader :heavy_check_mark:
- Add name getter to abstract class shape and subclasses :heavy_check_mark:
- Clear debugging prints in sdfloader
- renderer (currently working on it)
- intersect() for triangle class (maybe...)
- lots of other funny stuff :poop:

## Attention:

Use underscores only at the ends of membernames... it’s not compiling :poop: , why the hell ever?! [¯\_(ツ)_/¯](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32UGD0fV45g)
